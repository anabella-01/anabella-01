## Hey everyone! I'm Annie ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m Annie, a Front-end developer whoâ€™s always learning and growing.

Although I donâ€™t have formal work experience yet, my personal projects and contributions showcase my progress, dedication, and effort. Iâ€™m disciplined and consistent in my learning, always with clear goals guiding my path.

I love collaborating and sharing my knowledge with the community. I enjoy working in teams and value constructive feedback, which I always receive with humility and an open attitude towards improvement. I donâ€™t settle for doing things halfway; I put in a lot of effort and strive to learn and apply what I donâ€™t know effectively.

Each line of code is a new opportunity to grow, and I work hard to develop solutions that challenge and help me advance. Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and growing, and I appreciate any chance to collaborate and improve.

Thanks for checking out my profile!
